				<h2>The Races</h2>
				<p>Racing+ allows you to do several types of races. And you can race either by yourself, or with other people. The different race formats <a href="https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-client/blob/master/mod/CHANGES-RACES.md">are listed on GitHub</a>.</p>

				<h2>The Mod</h2>
				<p>The Racing+ Lua mod fixes many bugs that remain unpatched in the vanilla game. It also introduces some small balance changes. All of the changes <a href="https://github.com/Zamiell/racing-plus/blob/main/docs/CHANGES.md">are listed on GitHub</a>.</p>
				<p>One other major feature of the Racing+ mod is that it facilitates different kinds of multi-character speedruns by implementing custom challenges. You can <a href="https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-client/blob/master/mod/CHANGES-CHALLENGES.md">read about them on GitHub</a>.</p>
				<p>You might also be interested in <a href="https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-client/blob/master/docs/HISTORY.md">the version history</a>.</p>
				<p>Additionally, there is also <a href="https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-client/blob/master/docs/BUGS.md">a list of known bugs with the mod</a>.

				<h3>What is the difference between ranked and unranked?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>All multiplayer races are ranked in that the results will feed into the leaderboards. There is a separate multiplayer leaderboard for seeded, unseeded, and diversity.</li>
					<li>For solo races, you have the option between "Unranked" and "Ranked". Think of unranked as a practice mode.</li>
					<li>For solo ranked races, you can only do "Unseeded". This is documented <a href="https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-client/blob/master/mod/CHANGES-RACES.md#unseeded-solo-ranked">on Github</a>.</li>
					<li>Solo ranked seeded may come at some point in the future.</li>
				</ul>

				<div style="height: 1em;" id="faq-on-launch"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>What does Racing+ do when it starts up?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>It checks to make sure you have at least one fully unlocked save file.</li>
					<li>It checks to make sure your Racing+ Lua mod is not corrupted, since Steam sucks at keeping it in sync with the latest version. If you do not have the Racing+ Lua mod at all, then it will skip this part.</li>
				</ul>

				<div style="height: 1em;" id="faq-mods"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>
					Is it possible to use Racing+ to race without any mods?<br />
					Is it possible to use Racing+ with a custom mod or multiple mods?
				</h3>
				<p class="margin-half">
					Yes! Perform the following steps:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Open the Racing+ program and make sure you are in the lobby.</li>
					<li>Go into the game's "Mods" menu and disable all mods (or enable only the custom mods that you want to play).</li>
					<li>Exit the game and reopen it, which ensures that all of the mods are loaded/unloaded correctly.</li>
					<li>On the Racing+ program, create a new race with a format of "Custom".</li>
					<li>Now, have your friends join the race. That's it!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Remember to communicate to everyone in the race which mods are to be used and what the rules are.</p>

				<div style="height: 1em;" id="faq-install-path"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>
					Where does Racing+ get installed to?<br />
					Where is the log file located?
				</h3>
				<p>The mod gets installed (via Steam) to:</p>
				<p><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\mods\racing+_857628390</code></p>
				<p>The client gets installed to:</p>
				<p><code>C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Programs\RacingPlus</code></p>
				<p>The client settings are stored in:</p>
				<p><code>C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Programs\settings.json</code></p>
				<p>The log file is located at:</p>
				<p><code>C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Programs\Racing+ ####-##-##.log</code> (matching the date)</p>

				<div style="height: 1em;" id="faq-corrupt"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>What do I do if the mod doesn't seem to be working correctly in-game?</h3>
				<p>Sometimes, after an update, Steam can download a corrupted version of the mod. If you launch the client and are able to get to the lobby, the client should automatically heal a corrupted mod. If that doesn't work, try nuking your Racing+ mod manually by deleting the mod directory located at:</p>
				<p><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\mods\racing+_857628390</code></p>
				<p>After deleting it, close Steam, reopen Steam, wait for the Steam download progress bar to complete, and then launch Isaac.</p>

				<div style="height: 1em;" id="faq-edens-blessing-bug"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>How do I fix the bug where I start with an extra random item at the beginning of every run?</h3>
				<p>This doesn't have anything to do with Racing+. It is actually a bug with Eden's Blessing in the vanilla game. To fix it:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Disable all mods.</li>
					<li>Exit the game.</li>
					<li>Open the game.</li>
					<li>Enter a run with no easter eggs or seeds.</li>
					<li>Hold R to reset once.</li>
					<li>Go back to the main menu and re-enable mods.</li>
					<li>Exit the game.</li>
					<li>Open the game.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>After that, the bug should be fixed.</p>

				<div style="height: 1em;" id="faq-log-error"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>What do I do if the client won't let me click the "Ready" button?</h3>
				<p>If you are started a run and the client is not detecting it, you probably have one of two problems.</p>
				<p><strong>1)</strong> Your Isaac installation could be corrupted. Open up your Isaac "log.txt" file, which is located here by default:</p>
				<p><code>C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Repentance\log.txt</code></p>
				<p>Search for the word "error". If you see something like this:</p>
				<p><pre>[INFO] - Running Lua Script: resources/scripts/main.lua
[INFO] - ERR: cannot open resources/scripts/main.lua: No such file or directory
[INFO] - There was an error running the lua file: resources/scripts/main.lua</pre></p>
				<p>This means that certain files are missing in your <code>resources</code> folder that are necessary for mods to run. Completely nuke your Isaac installation, ensure that all of the files are deleted, and then reinstall.</p>
				<p><strong>2)</strong> You could have multiple installations of Isaac on your computer and Racing+ is pointed at the wrong "log.txt" file. From the lobby, click the "Settings" button at the top. This will allow you to change the log file that the Racing+ client is pointed at.</p>
				<p>As a troubleshooting step, verify that you are looking at the right log file by starting a run, writing down the seed, opening up the "log.txt" file in Notepad, and searching to see if the game wrote the seed to the log file. If it didn't, then you need to find your real "log.txt" file and have Racing+ point to that one!</p>

				<div style="height: 1em;" id="faq-username"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>How do I change my username?</h3>
				<p>Once you sign up with a username, you can't change it. If you really, really need to change your username, contact an administrator.</p>

				<div style="height: 1em;" id="faq-release"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>When will Racing+ be out of beta?</h3>
				<p>When it has achievements and all of the feature additions that I am planning.</p>

				<div style="height: 1em;" id="faq-emotes"></div><!-- Spacing -->
				<h3>My favorite emote doesn't work in the chat. Can you add it?</h3>
				<p>Yes. Send it to an administrator on Discord.</p>
