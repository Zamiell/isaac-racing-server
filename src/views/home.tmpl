				<p>A desktop client works together with a Repentance mod to allow you to chat and race with up to 100 people at the same time. Streaming is encouraged, but not required.</p>

				<h3>Statistics &amp; Leaderboards</h3>
				<p>The server will keep track of all of your races and times. Compete with others to get the lowest average time. Unlike the Daily Challenge leaderboards, cheaters will be banned.</p>
